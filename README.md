# About Me
My interest in cybersecurity started after I became a victim of credit card fraud. Experiencing that firsthand made me curious about how attackers exploit systems and how those attacks can be stopped. Since then, I’ve focused on building practical skills to protect networks, data, and users through effective security controls and monitoring.
